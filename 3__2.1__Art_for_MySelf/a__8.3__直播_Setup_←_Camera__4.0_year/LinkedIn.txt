✔ Hello, there! This is Xiè Chén-Zhú, a physicist whose neural network wanders outside the well-trained neural networks of large language models (LLMs). 

Two things I excel at happen to be areas where LLMs, along with all data-driven sciences they represent (e.g. PINN), aren't proficient: one is a ballistic trajectory prediction tool developed during my undergraduate studies, and the other is Nonlinear Fourier Optics theory established with 60,000 lines of python code during my doctoral program — both involve solving complex partial differential equations that reflect the objective physical reality surrounding us.

Solving equations itself is equivalent to modeling: the solution method of equations (flowchart) is equivalent to the model weights and bias grid, but unlike data-driven models, the flowchart leading to analytical solutions of equations is the performance limit of LLMs, with lowest degrees of freedom, minimum parameter scale, highest self-information (entropy/density).

Solving equations itself is equivalent to modeling: the solution method of equations (flowchart) is equivalent to the model weights and bias grid, but unlike data-driven models, the flowchart leading to analytical solutions of equations is the performance limit of LLMs, with lowest degrees of freedom, minimum parameter scale, highest self-information (entropy/density).

Data-driven LMs are compressed representations of the human experiential world. However, the forefront of physics lacks sufficient data to feed into LMs: physicists already at the edge of human cognition cannot even predict the behavior of equations THEMSELFS with high speed-precision product, meaning that they cannot generate high-quality data massively. So, where can high-quality physical LMs, as anticipated, come from!

Therefore, it is more appropriate to say that ✔ the minds of LMs are subsets of our minds, instead of saying that ✘ our minds are subsets of the minds of LMs.

This means that we should not lose faith in humanity: physics, which is the mathematical language of our mother nature, will be our final refuge, and on this ground, even LMs will humble themselves.
